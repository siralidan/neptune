        The Foreign Exchange Act mainly governs the activities of so-called foreign exchange entities carrying out cash bureau-de-change activities (non-cash exchange is governed by the Payment System Act). In addition, this act imposes some obligations on residents and non-residents.
    </p>
    <p class="text-xs">
        In every country, there are many different companies operating on the money exchange market, in just the same way as any other service business. These money exchange companies can be anything from one-off operations to major global brands, but all have to be regulated by the National Bank of the country in which it operates.
    </p>
    <p class="text-xs">
        Supervision of bureaux-de-change is an integral part of maintaining the stability of the financial system in the Czech Republic and promoting its sound and smooth development. In the case of bureau-de-change activity, this means in particular strengthening the credibility and soundness of bureau-de-change service provision, including compliance with rules of transparent exchange rate disclosure. Bureaux-de-change are classed as risky also because we can be misused for money laundering.
    </p>
    <p class="text-xs">
        Bureau-de-change activity, where not carried on by a credit institution, may only be performed by a natural person or legal entity registered by the Czech National Bank. Persons carrying on bureau-de-change activity on the basis of a license issued by a trade licensing office or a foreign exchange license were allowed to carry on such activity on the basis of such authorizations only until 28 February 2010. Thereafter we were obliged to terminate such activity or apply to the CNB for registration.
    </p>
    <p class="text-xs">
        Certain requirements are imposed on new enterprises, such as: the IP cannot act as an investment company or securities firm. Brokerage licenses are issued only to LLCs or JSCs. Regardless of the type of firm, the minimum amount of the authorized capital is set at 125 thousand euros.

        An investment firm is a company whose main activity is providing investment services.
    </p>
    <p class="text-xs">
        A license is needed to operate as an investment firm, and this is issued by Finantsinspektsioon.
    </p>
    <p class="text-xs">
        Applying for an operating license as an investment firm: The operating license is not time-limited, is non-transferable, and may not be acquired or used by anybody else. Operating licences are issued either separately for the provision of some investment services or for all investment services. Investment firms may provide only those investment services for which we have an operating license. To provide other investment services, the investment firm must apply for an additional operating license.
    </p>
    <p class="text-xs">
        To apply for an operating license, an application must be submitted to Finantsinspektsioon comprising a written notification and the annexes listed in the Securities Market Act.

    </p>
    <p class="text-xs">
        If an investment firm registered in Estonia wants to establish a subsidiary or branch to provide investment services in a foreign country or to take a large enough holding in an investment firm from a foreign country to make that into a subsidiary, it must apply to Finantsinspektsioon for permission to do so.
    </p>
    <p class="text-xs">
        Providing cross-border investment services in Estonia: Neither the provider of cross-border investment services itself nor its branch need be registered in Estonia. Investment firms registered in the European Economic Area may start to provide cross-border investment services in Estonia after the securities markets supervisory institution of the firm’s home country has forwarded to Finantsinspektsioon a notification of this with the business plan and description of planned services. The investment firm providing cross-border investment services must give notification in writing of proposed changes to business plan in good time to both Finantsinspektsioon and the securities markets supervisory institution of its home country.

    <p class="text-xs">
        The design of the Act is to protect investors and safeguard market integrity by establishing a set of harmonized requirements governing the activities of authorized firms and to promote fair, transparent, efficient, and integrated financial markets.
    </p>
    <p class="text-xs">
        The requirements under the Act (and underlying regulations) are relatively extensive and cover compliance arrangements, internal systems and controls, outsourcing, record-keeping, conflicts of interest, and the safeguarding of client assets or money held by firms.
    </p>
    <p class="text-xs">
        Investment Firms, authorized in Gibraltar, are also required to be members of the Investor Compensation Scheme. Applicants should submit an application pack with all relevant documents.

        A Bureau de Change is an establishment at which customers primarily exchange foreign currency. This regulated activity allows you to offer currency exchange services as a Bureau de Change, and this permission is granted under Part 7 of the Financial Services Act.
    </p>
    <p class="text-xs">
        To apply for this permission, applicants should submit an application pack along with all relevant documents. Currently, there are no specific capital requirements for bureaux de change. However, it is expected that firms hold at least three months' worth of expenses to ensure an orderly wind-down of the firm in the event of closure.
    </p>
    <p class="text-xs">
        The business plan submitted should clearly and comprehensively outline:
    </p>
    <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-xs">
        <li>How the firm will ensure compliance with all anti-money laundering requirements.</li>
        <li>How the firm assesses the risks associated with money laundering.</li>
        <li>Internal controls in place to mitigate the identified risks, particularly those associated with money laundering.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="text-xs">
        The Gibraltar Financial Services Commission (GFSC) will evaluate the application and seek evidence that the firm has considered and documented the risk, compliance, and operational issues associated with the proposed activities. It is important that the business plan aligns with the firm's risk appetite and capacity.
    </p>
    <p class="text-xs">
        The regulation and supervision of bureaux de change primarily aim to counter the risks of money laundering associated with this industry, thereby enhancing and protecting Gibraltar's reputation as a leading finance center. Therefore, applicants should ensure strict adherence to anti-money laundering requirements, especially as outlined in the GFSC's AML/CFT Guidance Notes.

    <p class="text-lg font-bold text-purple-800 mb-4">
        Isle Of Man Crowdfunding Platforms
    </p>
    <p class="text-xs">
        Crowdfunding is the process by which individuals or businesses seek to raise money from a variety of sources other than traditional funding sources such as high street banks and building societies. Most often, those seeking investment through crowdfunding aim to reach a wide audience, including the general public and institutional investors, who collectively form the "crowd" from whom investment is sought. In this context, the person seeking funds for a project is the "investee," and the person investing money into the project is the "investor."
    </p>
    <p class="text-xs">
        The most common method for investees to attract crowdfunding is by registering on a website or online portal known as a crowdfunding platform. Once registered, the investee's business model or project becomes available for all users of the platform to view and decide whether we wish to invest Our funds.
    </p>
    <p class="text-xs">
        In the Isle of Man, there is some overlap between loan-based crowdfunding and the Moneylenders Act 1991. Companies that lend money to individuals are required to register with the Office of Fair Trading (OFT).
    </p>
    <p class="text-xs">
        The Crowdfunding handbook is produced to provide license holders with a Class 6 Permission under the Financial Services Act 2008 (those licensed by the Isle of Man Financial Services Authority) conducting equity or loan-based crowdfunding in or from the Isle of Man, as well as potential license holders and other interested parties, with easy access to the legislation and guidance related to regulated crowdfunding activities.
    </p>
    <p class="text-xs">
        The primary legislation governing Crowdfunding Platforms in or from the Isle of Man is the Financial Services Act 2008.
    </p>
    <p class="text-xs">
        To obtain a Class 6 license and protect investors, crowdfunding platforms must have a paid-up share capital of at least £25,000 and demonstrate tangible net resources of at least £50,000. The FSA imposes strict conditions on Class 6 license holders, including a prohibition on providing recommendations or advice without a Class 2 license, a requirement to display a prominent warning on the crowdfunding platform about the risks of crowdfunding, and conducting due diligence checks on borrowers and lenders and having written terms of business with them.
    </p>
    <p class="text-xs">
        Distinctive benefits of crowdfunding in Isle of Man: The Isle of Man offers an attractive package for crowdfunding platforms to establish operations here. The Island has a world-class professional services industry, highly regulated, and the Isle of Man Government is proactive in encouraging business to flourish, including assisting non-Isle of Man businesses in moving to the Island. Frequent air and ferry links to the UK and Ireland are available, and the Isle of Man benefits from attractive personal and corporate taxation rates.

        Isle Of Man Special Purpose Vehicles / Insurance Linked Securities
    </p>
    <p class="text-xs">
        Insurance Special Purpose Vehicles (ISPVs): In March 2015, the Isle of Man Financial Services Authority introduced regulations, supported by guidance notes, to establish a regulatory framework for transactions commonly known as Insurance Linked Securities (ILS). These transactions include Catastrophe Bonds, Mortality Bonds, Industry Loss Warranties, Sidecars, and other collateralized insurance and reinsurance structures. This framework facilitates such transactions through ISPVs, which are insurance or reinsurance companies specifically licensed by the Authority for this purpose.
    </p>
    <p class="text-xs">
        Key differences between an ISPV and a conventional insurer or reinsurer include the following:
    </p>
    <ul class="list-disc list-inside">
        <li class="text-xs">An ISPV must only have (re)insureds and investors who are suitably sophisticated for this specialized form of business. Qualifying criteria for prospective participants can be found in the ISPV regulations and guidance.</li>
        <li class="text-xs">An ISPV must be fully funded through contractual arrangements with its participants, limiting the ISPV's liability to its available assets. This reduced risk to stakeholders and lower risk of insolvency result in simplified regulatory requirements and lower fees for ISPVs.</li>
        <li class="text-xs">An ISPV must be administered by an insurance manager registered under Part 6 of the Insurance Act 2008.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="text-xs">
        The ISPV application process is designed for fast licensing, with a target of 5 days or less from a fully completed application. Details regarding an application to be licensed as an Insurance Special Purpose Vehicle can be found in the Insurance (Special Purpose Vehicles) Regulations 2015 and the Guidance Notes for Insurance Special Purpose Vehicles (available on the FSA website).

    <p class="text-xs">
        The Malta Financial Services Authority (MFSA) is responsible for supervising entities authorized under the Financial Institutions Act (Cap. 376). These entities, referred to as 'financial institutions,' can be categorized into two broad categories:
        <ul class="list-disc list-inside">
            <li>Institutions undertaking payment services and/or the issuance of electronic money, commonly known as 'payment institutions' or 'electronic money institutions,' respectively.</li>

        </ul>
    </p>
    <p class="text-xs">
        The Financial Institutions Act 1994 (the Act) is closely related to the Banking Act 1994 and covers institutions engaged in activities listed in the Schedule to Article 2 of the Act, but do not accept deposits from or other funds repayable to the public. The Act provides financial institutions with operational flexibility while subjecting them to continuous supervision and regulation.
    </p>
    <p class="text-xs">
        <span class="font-bold">Licensing Requirements:</span> No financial institution can conduct its business without a license. The competent authority has the final say in determining whether a financial institution's business is in compliance with regulations.
        <br>Application for a license must adhere to the format required in the Financial Institutions Directive (FID/01). Statutory license requirements include minimum own funds (capital) in Maltese Liri or an equivalent amount in foreign currency, acceptable to the competent authority or established by it.
        <br>Additional requirements include adhering to the 'four eyes principle,' meeting fit and proper criteria, and fulfilling close links criteria. The license application should be processed within three months, with a possible extension of up to three months for additional information, but not exceeding six months in total.
    </p>
    <p class="text-xs">
        The Act outlines specific circumstances under which the competent authority could restrict, modify, or revoke a license, as well as instances where a license automatically becomes ineffective. The Act also provides procedures to be followed when the revocation of a license affects foreign regulators.
    </p>
    <p class="text-xs">
        <span class="font-bold">Regulatory and Investigatory Powers:</span> The MFSA, as the competent authority under the Act, fulfills its supervisory responsibilities through its Banking Unit, both off-site and on-site.

    <p class="text-xs">
        A financial service provider in the Netherlands offers financial products, provides advice, offers mediation services, reinsurance mediation services, or acts as an authorized agent in respect of financial products. The Dutch Authority for the Financial Markets (AFM) exercises conduct of business supervision over financial service providers.
    </p>
    <p class="text-xs">
        Banks and other financial companies in the Netherlands are regulated under the Financial Supervision Act, as well as related EU Directives. Various types of financial companies can be established under the Dutch Financial Supervision Act, including investment funds, asset and fund management companies, insurance companies, and dealers and brokerage companies. Each type of Dutch financial company is subject to specific licensing requirements based on the services we provide.
    </p>
    <p class="text-xs">
        The Dutch AFM and De Nederlandsche Bank (DNB) issue licenses for a range of financial activities, including providing advice on financial products, services related to collective investment schemes, management services for alternative investment companies, offering credits and loans, investment services, insurance services, and clearing activities in the form of audit companies.
    </p>
    <p class="text-xs">
        Opening a Dutch financial company involves several steps, including registering the company with the Dutch Companies Register and submitting an application with a business plan to the DNB or the AFM. Once the business plan is approved, you must prepare and submit various documents, including a Declaration of No Objection, an application for a specific activity license, an application for authorization to operate in Holland, and an application for authorization to act as a payment institution if applicable. Upon receiving the license, the company is entered into the register of licensed financial institutions in the Netherlands.

        Investment firms with Our registered office in countries other than Australia, the United States, the United Kingdom, or Switzerland need to obtain a license in the Netherlands.

    <div class="p-4">
    <p class="text-lg font-bold text-purple-800 mb-4">
        Malta Securitization Vehicle
    </p>
    <p class="text-xs">
        Malta’s Securitization Act (the “Act”) provides a legal framework for securitisation transactions that has been carefully designed to reflect both the specificities and wide variety of securitisation transactions brought to market. The Act provides statutory solutions and greater certainty of outcomes for many of the legal challenges that investors and credit rating agencies are typically concerned with, including true sale, bankruptcy remoteness and the privileges of securitisation creditors over the vehicle’s assets. The structural enhancements afforded to Maltese securitisation vehicles under the Act allow for competitive borrowing costs relative to any recognized issuer jurisdiction.
    </p>
    <p class="text-xs">
        Maltese securitisation vehicles can be used to structure various forms of securitisation transactions, including synthetic risk transfer securitisation, and a wide variety of asset-classes can be securitized, including credit card receivables, trade receivables, lease/charter payments for aircraft and ships, insurance risk, and income/royalty streams from intellectual property assets such as copyright, patents, and trademarks, to name a few.
    </p>
    <p class="text-xs">
        <span class="font-bold">Tax Neutrality:</span> Malta has specific rules on the tax treatment of securitisation vehicles that enable them to achieve tax neutrality in respect of the securitisation transactions for which the vehicles are established. These tax rules can be applied to eliminate tax leakage for securitisation vehicles established in Malta and to ensure that there is no Maltese tax liability for originators that are not Malta tax resident.
    </p>
    <p class="text-xs">
        <span class="font-bold">Tax Treaties:</span> Malta has an extensive Double Tax Treaty network in place with more than 65 Treaties currently in place.
    </p>
    <p class="text-xs">
        <span class="font-bold">Interest Payments:</span> No Maltese tax is payable on payments of interest by a securitisation vehicle to a holder of the vehicle’s securities that: <br>
        - is not resident in Malta; <br>
        - does not have a permanent establishment in Malta; and <br>
        - is not owned and controlled (directly or indirectly) by, or acts on behalf of, an individual who is ordinarily resident and domiciled in Malta.
    </p>
    <p class="text-xs">
        <span class="font-bold">Dividends:</span> No Maltese tax is payable on the payment of dividends by a securitisation vehicle to its shareholders.
    </p>
    <p class="text-xs">
        <span class="font-bold">Transfers of Securities:</span> No Maltese tax is payable on the transfer of any securities issued by a securitisation vehicle if the transferor is: <br>
        - not resident in Malta; and <br>
        - not owned and controlled (directly or indirectly) by, or acts on behalf of, an individual who is ordinarily resident and domiciled in Malta.
    </p>
    <p class="text-xs">
        <span class="font-bold">Stamp Duty:</span> A securitisation vehicle established as a Maltese company qualifies for a stamp duty exemption where more than 90% of its business interests are situated outside Malta.
    </p>
    <p class="text-xs">
        <span class="font-bold">Absence of Regulatory Authorizations:</span> Securitisation vehicles are specifically exempt from licensing or authorization requirements of any kind, irrespective of the kind of activities carried out by the vehicle, including where such activities would ordinarily require authorization (under the Investment Services Act or the Banking Act, for example).
    </p>
    <p class="text-xs">
        Securitisation vehicles are merely required to notify the MFSA of Our intent to enter into one or more securitisation transactions. The only exception is for a securitisation vehicle that (unusually) issues financial instruments to the public on a continuous basis, which would require authorization by the MFSA prior to issuing financial instruments to the public. Securitisation vehicles also qualify as financial vehicle corporations pursuant to Regulation (EU) 1075/2013 of the European Central Bank, with attendant quarterly statistical reporting requirements to the Central Bank of Malta.
