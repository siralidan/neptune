        Innovation and Fintech in Latvia
    </p>
    <p class="text-xs">
        Fintech, characterized by technology-driven financial innovation, is rapidly evolving in Latvia. This innovation aims to revolutionize traditional business models, processes, and services, ultimately delivering superior, more efficient, and modern financial solutions to Latvian consumers.
    </p>
    <p class="text-xs">
        The Financial and Capital Market Commission (FCMC) recognizes FinTech as a strategic direction and actively supports innovation in the financial sector. Together with other public institutions, the FCMC endeavors to foster a conducive environment for FinTech, encouraging the provision of innovative financial services and attracting new companies to Latvia.
    </p>
    <p class="text-xs">
        The regulatory sandbox, a key initiative, allows existing or potential financial market participants to test innovative financial products, services, or business models under the supervision of the FCMC. This sandbox promotes the development of innovative solutions that enhance the financial market's integrity, expand options for consumers and investors, and ensure the safe adoption of financial services.
    </p>
    <p class="text-xs">
        Latvia's financial and capital market is witnessing innovation driven by both regulatory frameworks and market participants' initiatives. Technologies such as artificial intelligence, biometric data, robo-advisors, and machine learning are shaping the landscape, alongside regulatory developments like the second payment service directive and strong customer authentication.
    </p>
    <p class="text-xs">
        Latvia stands out as a prominent destination for fintech companies, recognized for its startup-friendly environment. Latvia-based fintechs enjoy global reach, establishing operations worldwide and leveraging benefits such as low costs, access to local banking infrastructure, and streamlined licensing processes offered by the FCMC. Additionally, Latvia's startup ecosystem offers advantages like expedited startup visas, favorable tax regimes, and stock options regulation to attract tech talent.

        Fintech and TVTG in Liechtenstein
    </p>
    <p class="text-xs">
        In Liechtenstein, the Fintech sector operates within the framework of anti-money laundering legislation and licensing requirements. The Due Diligence Act (SPG) plays a crucial role in preventing money laundering and terrorist financing, covering licensed financial intermediaries like banks, asset managers, as well as entities not subject to financial market regulations such as real estate brokers.
    </p>
    <p class="text-xs">
        The creation of the Transaction Systems and Trustworthy Technology Service Providers Act (TVTG) delegates the registration and supervision of new service providers operating on TT systems (e.g., blockchain) to the Financial Market Authority (FMA). The TVTG also aligns with FATF recommendations, ensuring supervision under the Due Diligence Act for relevant services.
    </p>
    <p class="text-xs">
        According to Article 12(1) of the TVTG, individuals or entities based in Liechtenstein intending to offer TT services professionally must apply for registration with the FMA before commencing operations. This requirement extends to Token Issuers issuing tokens exceeding CHF 5 million within a 12-month period.

        Estonia Insurance Intermediaries
    </p>
    <p class="text-xs">
        An insurance intermediary specializes in intermediating insurance contracts and earns a fee for doing so. Insurance intermediaries in Estonia are divided into insurance brokers and insurance agents. The roles of an insurance broker and an insurance agent are fundamentally different, as an insurance broker represents the interests of the policyholder, while the agent represents the interests of the insurance company.

        For an insurance broker to be entered in the list of insurance intermediaries, an application must be submitted in writing to Finantsinspektsioon. The decision of whether to accept the entry in the list or to refuse it is taken by Finantsinspektsioon within one month after the documents and data required by law have been submitted.

    <p class="text-xs">
        Insurance and Reinsurance Mediation refers to any activity involving the advising on, proposing or undertaking of preparatory work for entering into insurance contracts, including administration and performance of insurance contracts. Insurance intermediaries are brokers or agents who represent consumers in insurance transactions. Two types of regulated activity you can apply for:
    </p>
    <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-xs">
        <li>General/Non-Life Business.</li>
        <li>Life Business.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="text-xs">
        Applicants should submit an application form and additional documentation with all relevant documents. An Insurance or Reinsurance Intermediary is required to hold an initial and ongoing capital of:
    </p>
    <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-xs">
        <li>€19,510; or</li>
        <li>4% of the sum of annual premiums received or as projected at application, whichever is the greater.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="text-xs">
        Subject to the above, the GFSC expects firms to hold a minimum level of financial resources equivalent to 3 months’ worth of operating expenses (or as projected at application).
    </p>
    <p class="text-xs">
        There are prescribed minimum requirements established under the Act regarding the premises, capital, solvency, management, staff, and resources that have to be attained to be licensed. Insurance and Reinsurance Intermediaries are required to have on a permanent basis:
    </p>
    <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-xs">
        <li>Professional Indemnity Insurance covering the whole territory of the Union, guaranteeing against liability arising from professional negligence, for at least €1,300,380 (or sterling equivalent) applying to each claim and in aggregate €1,924,560 (or sterling equivalent) per year for all claims.</li>
        <li>Ensuring that money paid by the policyholder to the Intermediary is treated as having already been paid to the Insurance Company, whereas money paid by the Insurance Company to the Intermediary is not treated as having been paid to the policyholder until the customer actually receives it.</li>
        <li>Ensuring that policyholders’ money is only transferred via strictly segregated client accounts and that these accounts shall not be used to reimburse other creditors in the event of bankruptcy.</li>
        <li>Ensuring we have adequate mechanisms for receiving and dealing with Complaints.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="text-xs">
        Life Insurance and Life Reinsurance Intermediaries must comply with the GFSC’s Anti-money laundering Guidance Notes.
