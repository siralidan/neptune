    <p class="text-xs">
        The laws and regulations in the insurance area apply to domestic insurance companies and domestic reinsurance companies under the Insurance Act and insurance intermediaries and independent loss adjusters under the Act on Insurance Intermediaries and Independent Loss Adjusters. Branches of foreign insurance and reinsurance companies from non-EEA countries are also regulated in respect of activities carried on within the Czech Republic. Branches of foreign insurance companies from EEA countries are subject to regulation of and supervision by the country in which Our head offices are located.
    </p>
    <p class="text-xs">
        In general, insurance activity in the Czech Republic can be undertaken by:
    </p>
    <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-xs">
        <li>an insurer with a Czech insurance license granted by the Czech Insurance Market Regulator, the Czech National Bank (the “CNB”);</li>
        <li>an insurer based in another EU or EEA member state which has established a branch in the Czech Republic;</li>
        <li>an insurer based outside the EU or EEA which has established a branch in the Czech Republic and has obtained a Czech insurance license; and</li>
        <li>an insurer based in the EU or EEA that has undertaken insurance business in the Czech Republic on a temporary basis.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="text-xs">
        The CNB (as the Czech Insurance Market Regulator) can grant a Czech insurance license to a joint-stock company, a cooperative established under Czech law, or a Czech branch of the insurance company based outside the EU or EEA.
    </p>
    <p class="text-xs">
        Insurers based in EU and EEA member states can operate in the Czech Republic through a branch established in the Czech Republic. We do not need to obtain a special license from the CNB to establish a branch. However, we must fulfill information obligations with respect to the Insurance Market Regulator in Our home member state before undertaking insurance activities in the Czech Republic. It is less expensive for an insurer from the EU or EEA to establish a branch office in the Czech Republic, rather than obtaining a license from the CNB. Insurers from countries outside the EU and the EEA can also establish a branch in the Czech Republic but this is usually rather lengthy and costly as it involves obtaining a special license from the CNB.

        An insurance intermediary specializes in intermediating insurance contracts and earns a fee for doing so.

        Insurance and Reinsurance Mediation refers to any activity involving the advising on, proposing or undertaking of preparatory work for entering into insurance contracts, including administration and performance of insurance contracts. Insurance intermediaries are brokers or agents who represent consumers in insurance transactions. Two types of regulated activity you can apply for:

        <li>Ensuring that money paid by the policyholder to the Intermediary is treated as having already been paid to the Insurance Company, whereas money paid by the Insurance Company to the Intermediary is not treated as having been paid to the policyholder until the customer actually receives it.</li>
        <li>Ensuring that policyholders’ money is only transferred via strictly segregated client accounts and that these accounts shall not be used to reimburse other creditors in the event of bankruptcy.</li>

New composite insurers are no longer allowed except where the life/non-life insurance business is incidental in terms of premium income to the principal non-life/life insurance business being written by the licensed insurer, or where the licensed insurer is a protected cell or incorporated cell company.

    <p class="text-xs">
        Insurers licensed in Guernsey can be international insurers, which underwrite non-local insurance risks, or domestic insurers, which underwrite wholly, or primarily, Bailiwick of Guernsey insurance risks. International insurers can be classified into two types as follows:

        The Protected Cell Companies Act 2004 and the Insurance (Protected Cell Companies) Regulations 2004 provide a framework for the operation of Protected Cell Companies on the Island. The Regulations provide for the establishment of new protected cell insurance companies, and also for the conversion of existing insurance companies into protected cell companies.
    </p>
    <p class="text-xs">
        A protected cell company, or PCC, can be thought of as being a standard limited company that has been separated into legally distinct portions or cells. The revenue streams, assets, and liabilities of each cell are kept separate from all other cells. Each cell has its own separate portion of the PCC's overall share capital, allowing shareholders to maintain sole ownership of an entire cell while owning only a small proportion of the PCC as a whole. PCCs can provide a means of entry into the captive insurance market to entities for which it was previously uneconomic. The overheads of a protected cell captive can be shared between the owners of each of the cells, making the captive cheaper to run from the point of view of the insured.
    </p>
    <p class="text-xs">
        The Incorporated Cell Companies Act 2010, Incorporated Cells Regulations 2011, and Insurance (Incorporated Cell Companies) Regulations 2011 provide a framework for the operation of incorporated cell companies on the Island and set out the requirements that must be observed by incorporated cell companies carrying on, or wishing to carry on, insurance business.
    </p>
    <p class="text-xs">
        An incorporated cell company, or ICC, is based on the same principles as a PCC. It is a company that has the power to establish incorporated cells as part of its corporate structure, but in an ICC, each incorporated cell is a separate legal entity.

        Maltese insurance business legislation transposes European Union Insurance Directives which regulate the taking-up and pursuit of direct insurance, reinsurance and the carrying out of insurance intermediaries’ activities. Malta’s E.U. membership enables insurance companies licensed in Malta to benefit from EU passporting rights, that is, by virtue of a simple system of notification of the home country regulator to the host country regulator, a Malta based insurance company may write directly into other EU/EEA markets without the need to apply for another additional license in the host Member State.

        Insurance intermediaries play a crucial role as the link between insurance companies seeking to place insurance policies and consumers looking to procure insurance coverage. Traditionally known as "brokers," "agents," or "producers," intermediaries provide advice, information, and other services related to the solicitation, negotiation, and sale of insurance.
    </p>

        Insurance and reinsurance intermediaries must obtain authorization from the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA).

    </p>
    <p class="text-xs">
        The application process for insurance intermediaries is similar to that for insurance companies, with relevant forms available on the FCA website. The application fee varies depending on the complexity:

        General insurance provides non-life insurance cover for damage or loss, including products such as motor, travel, pet, health, and home insurance. In 2013, the UK government implemented significant reforms to regulate the financial services sector, including insurance. This led to the establishment of two regulatory bodies:
    </p>
    <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-xs">
        <li>The Prudential Regulatory Authority (PRA), which promotes the safety and soundness of insurers and protects policyholders.</li>

    </ul>
    <p class="text-xs">
        Licensing of insurance in the UK involves obtaining the relevant Part 4A FSMA permission from the PRA, unless exempt or relying on the EU's passporting regime. Applicants must satisfy "threshold conditions" related to authorization, ongoing capitalization, management systems, and the fitness of senior management. The application process requires submission of detailed forms and a business plan, with a non-refundable application fee of GBP 25,000 (approximately USD 32,360).
    </p>
    <p class="text-xs">
        Authorized insurers must also pay an annual fee to the PRA. Taxation for companies operating in general insurance business in the UK is subject to normal corporation tax rules.
