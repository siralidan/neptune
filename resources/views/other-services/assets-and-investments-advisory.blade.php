      Following comments from the IMF report in 2009, the Council of Ministers considered proposals put forward by the then Chief Secretary’s Office (now the Cabinet Office) to place responsibility on the Isle of Man Financial Services Authority (“the Authority") for the oversight of the adherence of certain businesses and professions (“Designated Businesses”) to the Island’s anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism legislation (“AML/CFT legislation”).
    </p>
    <p class="text-xs">
      Designated Businesses are also commonly referred to as Designated Non-Financial Businesses and Professions or “DNFBPs”.

      Designated businesses are registered and overseen by the Authority for AML/CFT compliance only –they retain Our current status with the various bodies (if any) responsible for Our wider business, competence or other matters, such as the Isle of Man Law Society, the ICAEW, ACCA, CIMA, the Office of Fair Trading etc.
    </p>
    <p class="text-xs mt-4">
      <span class="font-bold">Registration Policy</span><br>
      The Authority’s General Registration Policy ("the Registration Policy") sets out the criteria that applicants must satisfy to be successful in the registration of Our business. The Authority will not register a business where it feels that the applicant, including the persons associated with it, are not fit and proper to undertake the designated business.
    </p>
    <p class="text-xs">
      The fit and proper test is both an initial test at the time of registration and a continuing test in relation to the compliance with AML/CFT legislation of designated business.
    </p>
    <p class="text-xs">
      Once registered, a designated business must advise the Authority of any changes in its circumstances, within 14 days of the change. The changes that should be notified include any changes to the information submitted at registration such as contact details or details of those charged with the governance of the business.
    </p>
    <p class="text-xs">
      Each year, a registered designated business is required to submit an annual return. This is made available on the online portal from the 1 October of each year and must be submitted by 1 November of that year. If the annual return is not submitted by 1 November, the Authority will issue a civil penalty to the business in line with the Designated Businesses (Civil Penalties) Order 2015.

      Wealth management firms offer investment management and comprehensive financial advice. Wealth managers handle complex financial issues and coordinate financial experts on behalf of clients. Wealth management is a financial service provided to customers who have signed an agreement with a firm to have Our money or investments managed.
    </p>
    <p class="text-xs">
      This is done on either a discretionary or advisory basis:
    </p>
    <ul class="list-disc ml-8 text-xs">
      <li>A discretionary service is where the firm manages your portfolio of investments in line with instructions given by you. This means the firm will manage your portfolio and will make alterations without checking with you.</li>
      <li>An advisory service is where the firm will make recommendations based on your attitude to risk and circumstances, but you will need to agree to any changes before we are made to your portfolio.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="text-xs">
      There are no formal requirements needed to become a Wealth Manager. However, you will need to have a good level of previous experience and an in-depth knowledge of the finance industry. Regulations and authorization of wealth managers are the same as for investment managers.
