      Credit unions and banks are together referred to as “credit institutions”. In many cases, particularly as regards prudential requirements, we are subject to the same rules. The National Bank of the country acts as the regulator of the financial market in the Czech Republic. The advantage of conducting banking activities in the Czech Republic is the presence of the process of passportization.
    </p>
    <p class="text-xs">
      The procedure for obtaining banking license starts from the moment of submitting application by the applicant. The main requirement for foreign companies is the establishment of Our own bank in the country. The branch should be acting and refer to the organizational and legal form of LLC or JSC. The legal entity is also obliged to register settlement account and contribute the authorized capital in the amount corresponding to the selected organizational and legal form. Minimum regulatory capital of the bank in the Czech Republic equals to 500 million CZK (approximately 18 million 700 thousand EUR).
    </p>
    <p class="text-xs">
      Consideration of the application takes no more than 8 months from the date of delivery of the package of documents to the commission for financial regulation. The certificate has unlimited period of validity, however, annual renewal of the permission is required.

      The main job of a credit institution, or bank, is to take in deposits of money and other repayable funds from the public and to issue loans on its own account or to finance them in other ways. To create a credit institution, an activity license needs to be applied for from Finantsinspektsioon.

    <p class="text-xs">
      Only businesses that take in deposits from the public have the right to use the name ‘bank’. The only businesses established in Estonia that are allowed to take in deposits from the public are those that have a license from Finantsinspektsioon to operate as a credit institution.

    <p class="text-xs">
      Applying for an operating license as a credit institution: To receive an operating license, the members of the management of the business being set up or operating must submit a written application to Finantsinspektsioon and the documents and data listed in the Credit Institutions Act. When a bank is founded the share capital paid in must be at least five million euros. Only real sums paid in may be indicated as equity capital of the bank. The bank cannot be founded with publicly subscribed shares. The procedures for issuing an operating license to a bank take 6-12 months. The decision to issue an operating license or to refuse it is taken by Finantsinspektsioon within six months after all the necessary documentation and data have been received, and not later than 12 months after the application for the operating license has been received. The fee for applying for an operating license as a credit institution is 1500 euros.

      Providing cross-border services in Estonia: A credit institution from an EEA state that wants to start providing cross-border services in Estonia informs Finantsinspektsioon through the financial supervision authority of that state, indicating the transactions and operations that it intends to start providing. A credit institution from an EEA state may start providing cross-border services in Estonia once the notification has been sent to Finantsinspektsioon by the financial supervision authority of the EEA state.

According to the Banking Act, a credit institution can undertake a number of activities which are specified in the same Act. The taking of deposits from retail customers is the licensable activity that distinguishes a credit institution from other licensed entities.

      Regulatory Bodies for Credit Institutions
    </p>
    <p class="text-xs">
      In order to offer such credit facilities, banks must abide by strict regulation as well as meet certain requirements on an ongoing basis. Malta has one regulator for all financial services, the Malta Financial Services Authority (MFSA). It is the MFSA that will consider applications for credit institutions as the local competent authority but will then liaise with the European Central Bank (ECB) in order for any license to be issued. Large credit institutions deemed to be of critical importance to the national and/or European banking sector are not only regulated by the MFSA but are also directly regulated by the European Central Bank.

    <p class="text-xs">
      The Depositor Compensation Scheme and Credit Institutions
    </p>
    <p class="text-xs">
      As part of the requirements to be licensed as a credit institution, entities are required to contribute to the Depositor Compensation Scheme. The Scheme refers to a fund set up as a contingency for insolvent banks licensed by the MFSA under the Malta Banking Act within the European Economic Area (“EEA”), that are not able to provide payment to depositors, thus ensuring the stability of the financial system in Malta. Compensation for deposits at credit institutions is capped at a maximum of EUR 100,000 per depositor held within that credit institution. Additional compensation of up to EUR 500,000 may be awarded in special cases.
    </p>
    <p class="text-xs">
      License requirements
    </p>
    <p class="text-xs">
      In order to obtain a credit institution license in Malta, the applicant must contribute and maintain own funds as a minimum share capital of EUR 5 million, and a minimum of two people must manage the operation of the Malta credit institution. Further functions will be required to be carried out either by additional staff or through outsourcing arrangements – the MFSA will need to be convinced that the proposed structure is adequate to the planned business model and volumes. Applications, where the credit institution will be at least partly owned by a licensed bank or financial institution, tend to be preferred, although it is possible to demonstrate alternative means of soundness and stability. All applications are submitted to the MFSA and must include a business plan, demonstrating how liquidity and minimum capital requirements will be met and maintained, as well as due diligence exercises and regulatory compliance.

    <p class="text-xs">
      Special institution set up to issue mortgage bonds and grant long-term loans to its affiliated banks. Two such institutions were established in Switzerland in 1930, namely the Central Mortgage Bond Institution of the Swiss Cantonal Banks and the Mortgage Bond Bank of the Swiss Mortgage Institutions.
    </p>
    <p class="text-xs">
      Mortgage bonds are debt securities used for the long-term financing of senior mortgage loans granted by banks.
    </p>
    <p class="text-xs">
      Switzerland’s central mortgage bond institutions are supervised by FINMA on the basis of auditing and reporting conducted by licensed audit firms. Unlike conventional bonds, Swiss mortgage bonds offer extensive protection by law. The issuer and the lending banks are liable with Our own assets, while the borrowers are also liable towards the banks with Our mortgaged properties. This chain of security is unique worldwide.
    </p>
    <p class="text-xs">
      FINMA is responsible for supervising both of these institutions on an ongoing basis for which it relies largely on the auditing and reporting conducted by external audit firms.

      United Kingdom Building Societies
    </p>
    <p class="text-xs">
      A building society is a financial institution owned by its members as a mutual organization. Building societies offer banking and related financial services, especially savings and mortgage lending. We are similar to credit unions in organization, though few enforce a common bond. However, rather than promoting thrift and offering unsecured and business loans, the purpose of a building society is to provide home mortgages to members. Borrowers and depositors are society members, setting policy and appointing directors on a one-member, one-vote basis. Building societies often provide other retail banking services, such as current accounts, credit cards, and personal loans.
    </p>
    <p class="text-xs">
      The requirements for establishing a building society are set out in Section 5 and Part 1 of Schedule 2 to the Building Societies Act 1986. To establish a new society, ten or more persons must agree on a memorandum setting out the purpose (or principal purpose) and the extent of the powers of the intended society, in terms which comply with the 1986 Act and on rules for the regulation of the society which comply with the Act. All those persons (or at least 10), and the intended secretary, must then sign four copies of the memorandum and the rules and send them to the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) for consideration.
    </p>
    <p class="text-xs">
      There are strict capital requirements for setting up a new society - it must have adequate capital resources commensurate with the nature and scale of its business and the risks inherent in its business. It must maintain own funds of at least £1 million. The new organization would also have to have a proper business plan, funding and lending plans, and robust information technology, etc.

      A credit union is a financial co-operative which provides savings, loans, and a range of services to its members. It is owned and controlled by the members. The first credit union in Britain began trading in 1964, and over the last 50 years, credit unions have grown to provide loans and savings to more than 1.2 million people across England, Scotland, and Wales. Credit unions are owned by the people who use Our services, and not by external shareholders or investors. So the emphasis is always on providing the best service to members – not maximizing profits.
    </p>
    <p class="text-xs">
      Credit unions are dual-regulated, which means that we are regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and by the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA). The services that credit unions can offer include:

      <li>Savings</li>

      Members have a say in how Our credit union is run, and the directors are elected from the members, by the members, to represent Our interests. Profits are distributed to members in dividends.
