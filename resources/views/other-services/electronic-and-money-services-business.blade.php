    Czech Republic Payment Institutions/EMIs/Small Scale Payment Service Providers and Small Scale Electronic Issuers
  </p>
  <p class="text-xs">
    The regulations in the area of payment system institutions apply – to varying extents – to entities that are authorized or registered to perform the activities of payment institutions, electronic money institutions, electronic money issuers, or small-scale payment service providers. Some of these institutions are subject to similar regulation as banks and credit unions. Banks and credit unions may also provide payment services under conditions stipulated in the act regulating the activities of banks or credit unions.
  </p>
  <p class="text-xs">
    Electronic money becomes a necessity progressively as the general development of society. Due to interactive wallets, you can pay for any product or service without leaving your office or home. A certificate is not required for user management of a private virtual account.
  </p>
  <p class="text-xs">
    However, in the event that a legal entity plans to use the interactive currency continuously to conduct business or intends to create its own payment system, it must obtain a license for the use of electronic money.
  </p>
  <p class="text-xs">
    If you need a license of the Payment Institution to build your international payment services business, the Czech Republic is the best solution for your payment system and you are on the right site. The Czech license of the Payment Institution is a European license and gives the right to work throughout the European Union, without any limits in attracting clients from all over the world. And your employees can be where you decide.
  </p>
  <p class="text-xs">
    The Czech Republic regulates the activities of persons authorized to provide payment services and issue electronic money, according to the Act number 284/2009 Sb. and directive number 141/2011 Sb. Czech legislation and regulations regarding Payment Institutions fully comply with all EU directives, so the passportization in other EU countries after obtaining a Czech license is possible.
  </p>
  <p class="text-xs font-bold">
    License requirements for payment institutions:
  </p>
  <ul class="list-disc ml-6 text-xs">
    <li class="text-xs">A legal entity is a resident of the Czech Republic.</li>
    <li class="text-xs">The registered and head office is located in the Czech Republic.</li>

    <li class="text-xs">The business plan is available.</li>
    <li class="text-xs">Transparency and compliance of the business model with regulations and international rules.</li>
    <li class="text-xs">Directors are reliable persons in terms of reasonable provision of payment services.</li>
    <li class="text-xs">Key persons are employees who are able to effectively do business on payment services provision, who are competent and are sufficiently experienced in terms of reasonable and careful provision of payment services.</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="text-xs font-bold">
    Small-scale payment services provider:
  </p>
  <ul class="list-disc ml-6 text-xs">

    <li class="text-xs">Can provide services only in the Czech Republic. However, this does not prohibit customers from all over the world. And company employees can work remotely.</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="text-xs font-bold">
    Electronic money institution license:
  </p>
  <p class="text-xs">
    The license of the E-Money Institution - EMI or the Electronic Money Issuer includes all the capabilities of the Payment Institution. The main difference between the two types of payment service providers is that electronic institutions can issue electronic money. Electronic money is the digital equivalent of cash stored on an electronic device or remotely on a server. Unlike the Payment Institution, the Electronic Money Institution (EMI), issuing electronic money in exchange for money, provides financial services that are unlimited in time, without known payment directions, with the possibility of crushing and accumulating funds. The issuer undertakes the obligation to pay money in exchange for electronic money at any time.
  </p>
  <p class="text-xs">
    A company registered as a Small-Scale Electronic Money Institution is entitled to provide a full range of services, as well as the Electronic Money Institution (EMI), which is the most complete license of all types of payment system licenses, but with the limitations specified above.

  <p class="text-xs font-bold">
    Small-scale electronic money issuers license:
  </p>
  <ul class="list-disc ml-6 text-xs">
    <li class="text-xs">The issuer has the right to issue electronic money, provided that the average amount of electronic money issued by it in circulation over the past 6 months does not exceed the amount corresponding to 5,000,000 euros.</li>
    <li class="text-xs">The Issuer has the right to provide other payment services not related to electronic money. But the maximum average monthly volume of these payment services should not exceed 3,000,000 euros for the last 12 months. Those must not exceed 36 million euros for 12 months.</li>
