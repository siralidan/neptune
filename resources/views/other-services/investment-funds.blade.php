      Foreign investors have the option to establish either a company or an investment fund in the Czech Republic. The legislation governing investment funds in the Czech Republic differs from that which applies to commercial companies. Investment vehicles in the Czech Republic are regulated under the Act on Investment Companies and Investment Funds.
    </p>
    <p class="text-xs">
      Following the AIFMD and UCITS directives, the Investment Management and Investment Funds Regulation cover rules for products (funds) and providers (fund managers, administrators, depositaries) as well as other rules (cross-border services, marketing).
    </p>
    <p class="text-xs">
      The new Act on Investment Companies and Investment Funds introduces new investment opportunities for both local and foreign investors. It establishes new investment vehicles, including SICAV (investment company with variable capital) and trust funds. This Act aligns with regulations available under the Directive on Alternative Investment Fund Managers (AIMF).
    </p>
    <p class="text-xs">
      Under the new Act, which implements the AIMF regulations, alternative investment fund managers must register with the Czech National Bank (CNB). Additionally, individuals interested in investing capital in the Czech Republic must notify CNB.
    </p>
    <p class="text-xs">
      In 2013, the Czech government enacted new laws regulating investment funds to comply with EU directives. Three new forms of investment funds became available in the Czech Republic: the joint stock company with variable capital (SICAV), the limited partnership, and the trust fund. Additionally, investors can register mutual funds, joint stock companies, limited liability companies, and European companies. The fund legislation in the Czech Republic also provides for another type of vehicle – the Qualified Investor Fund (QIF).

      Investment and pension funds are collective investment pools managed by management companies with the principle of risk distribution.
    </p>
    <p class="text-xs">
      Investment funds in Estonia are categorized into public and non-public funds. Public funds target ordinary investors, while non-public funds cater to professional investors. Managing public investment and pension funds requires a license from Finantsinspektsioon, which can be withdrawn if necessary. Non-public fund managers must also obtain an operating license or register their activities with Finantsinspektsioon.
    </p>
    <p class="text-xs">
      Various types of investment funds can be established in Estonia, including euro funds (UCITS), alternative investment funds (AIF), statutory pension funds, and voluntary pension funds. These funds are typically established as contractual funds, although operating as a company (e.g., private limited company, public limited company, or limited partnership) is possible in certain cases.
    </p>
    <p class="text-xs">
      Approval of the conditions or statutes of investment funds varies based on whether they are public or non-public. Public investment fund conditions and statutes, including changes, require approval from Finantsinspektsioon. Non-public investment fund conditions and statutes are generally approved by the management board of the fund manager.

  <div class="p-4">
    <p class="text-lg font-bold text-purple-800 mb-4">Malta Collective Investment Schemes</p>,
    <p class="text-xs">Collective Investment Schemes are financial products where money from several different investors is pooled and then invested by a fund manager according to specific criteria. The scheme or fund is divided into segments called ‘units’, which are to some degree similar to shares. Investors take a stake in the fund by buying these units, we will therefore become unitholders. The price of a unit is based on the value of the investments the fund has invested in. Collective investment schemes may have different fee structures, make sure you understand how you will be charged before you invest as charges may have a major impact on the performance of your investment.</p>,
    <p class="text-xs">A collective investment scheme (CIS) is defined by the Malta Investment Services Act as a scheme or arrangement which has as its object the collective investment of capital acquired by means of an offer of units for subscription, sale or exchange and which has any of the following characteristics:</p>,
    <ul class="list-disc ml-4">
      <li class="text-xs">The scheme or arrangement operates according to the principle of risk spreading, and either:</li>,
      <li class="text-xs">The contributions of the participants and the profits or income out of which payments are to be made to them are pooled; or</li>,
      <li class="text-xs">At the request of the holders, units are or are to be re-purchased or redeemed out of the assets of the scheme, or arrangement, continuously or in blocks at short intervals; or</li>,
      <li class="text-xs">Units are, or have been, or will be issued continuously or in blocks at short intervals.</li>

      <li class="text-xs">UCITS Schemes: UCITS Schemes are open-ended schemes licensed in accordance with the provisions of the Investment Services Act.

      <li class="text-xs">Alternative Investment Funds: This category of funds includes non-UCITS Retail Schemes and Professional Investor Funds (PIFs). Non-UCITS Retail Schemes can be open-ended or closed-ended retail schemes. On the other hand, PIFs are regulated under a separate framework which is particularly suited for funds sold internationally on a private placement basis.</li>

    <p class="text-xs">Collective Investment schemes in Malta are monitored by the Malta Financial Services Authority which, besides having the responsibility for the licensing process, is also responsible for the regulation and ongoing supervision of Collective Investment Schemes.

    <ol class="list-decimal ml-4">
      <li class="text-xs">A written request by the AIFM in respect of an AIF – and its sub-funds, if any – to be included in the list of Notified AIFs in the form and manner as required by the MFSA;</li>,
      <li class="text-xs">Prior submission of (1) above, the governing body of the AIF shall approve a resolution certifying that the Prospectus of the AIF satisfies the minimum criteria as prescribed by the MFSA;</li>,
      <li class="text-xs">The AIFM shall submit the duly completed written notification together with the accompanying documents within thirty (30) calendar days from the date of the resolution of the governing body of the AIF whereby approving the AIF's prospectus and prior to the effective date of the prospectus;</li>,
      <li class="text-xs">The competent authority should include the AIF in the List of Notified AIFs within ten (10) working days from the date of filing of the notification request together with the completed required documentation.</li>
    </ol>,
    <p class="text-xs">Benefits of NAIF</p>,
    <p class="text-xs">Benefits include a quick process, which means fund managers can bring AIFs to market more swiftly. There is also no regulation of the AIF by the MFSA – as the name suggests, this framework only requires a notification. One important distinction to draw between the Notified AIF and the new QIAIF and RAIF structures in Ireland and Luxembourg, respectively, is that there is no requirement for domestic service providers to be appointed by the fund.</p>,

"Collective Investment Schemes in Netherlands": `
  <div class="p-4">
    <p class="text-lg font-bold text-purple-800 mb-4">Collective Investment Schemes in Netherlands</p>,
    <p class="text-xs">Collective Investment Schemes are more frequently known as ‘investment funds’, ‘mutual funds’ or simply ‘funds’. We invest in assets, such as bonds, equities, or cash. The collective assets owned by the fund are called a portfolio, and we are managed by a professional fund manager.</p>,
    <p class="text-xs">Under section 2:65 of the Financial Supervision Act (Wet op het financieel toezicht / Wft) companies that manage collective investment schemes are required to have a license. The Netherlands Authority for the Financial Markets (Autoriteit Financiële Markten) is the body that issues licenses to companies to act as management companies of collective investment schemes.</p>,
    <p class="text-xs">Following the Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive, a manager requires a registration in certain situations in order to manage an AIFM and/or to offer units or shares in the Netherlands to investors.</p>,
    <p class="text-xs font-bold">Features and requirements for AIFM in Netherlands</p>,
    <ul class="list-disc ml-4">
      <li class="text-xs">The process involves submission of a template application form plus numerous supporting documents to the Netherlands Authority for Financial Markets (“AFM”) for review. Part of the application is a test of suitability and reliability of the board members and supervisory board members of the AIFM</li>,
      <li class="text-xs">Additional forms must be provided along with the application form: – Notification form AIFs, Notification form AIFM depositary and Application form for suitability and reliability testing for each (supervisory) board member</li>,
      <li class="text-xs">The AFM can decide within 13 weeks, however, the AFM may use up to 26 weeks in which case the AFM will inform the applicant thereof. As such, the practical timetable is around 8 months (including preparation time)</li>,
      <li class="text-xs">The AFM charges an application fee of €5,500, and additional fees for the suitability and reliability tests.</li>,
      <li class="text-xs">Initial capital of €125,000 required, unless an AIF is set up as an investment entity with legal personality without a separate AIFM in which case initial capital of €300,000 is required. Additional own funds required if the AIFM does not have a separate professional indemnity insurance</li>,
      <li class="text-xs">In addition to AIFMD depositary, a ‘legal owner’ must be appointed if AIFM sets up AIFs without legal personality to hold the assets</li>,
      <li class="text-xs">Four eyes principle is applied. AIFM should have at least two day-to-day policymakers</li>,
      <li class="text-xs">AIFM with an official seat in the Netherlands, head office must be in the Netherlands</li>,
      <li class="text-xs">The standard corporate income tax rate on income is 20% (for profits up to €200,000) / 25% (for profits in excess of €200,000)</li>,
      <li class="text-xs">No withholding tax on interest and royalty payments. Standard Dutch dividend withholding tax rate on outgoing dividends is 15%, however, a reduction or exemption may be applicable on the basis of EU Parent-Subsidiary Directive, a double tax treaty or by the use of a Dutch “cooperative”. So tax-free repatriation to US, UK and a wide range of other jurisdictions is generally available</li>,
      <li class="text-xs">Income from employment is subject to income tax at progressive rates up to 52%. However, certain qualifying foreign employees that move to the Netherlands may be able to apply for a “30% ruling”, which may result in an effective maximum income tax rate of 36.4% (instead of 52%)</li>,
      <li class="text-xs">An AIFM must have legal personality under Dutch corporate law (typically a Dutch private limited company is incorporated). Incorporation requires the assistance of a Dutch civil law notary</li>,
      <li class="text-xs">The entity will need to be registered with the Dutch Chamber of Commerce.</li>
    </ul>,
    <p class="text-xs font-bold">Benefits of AIFM in Netherlands</p>,
    <ul class="list-disc ml-4">
      <li class="text-xs">Broad domestic and treaty dividend withholding tax exemptions</li>,
      <li class="text-xs">Limited quantitative requirements on corporate governance</li>,
      <li class="text-xs">Data protection legislation is very similar to the UK in terms of practical application</li>
    </ul>,

"Non-Guernsey Schemes (NGS)": `
  <div class="p-4">
    <p class="text-lg font-bold text-purple-800 mb-4">Non-Guernsey Schemes (NGS)</p>,
    <p class="text-xs">A Non-Guernsey Scheme (NGS) is a collective investment scheme that is not established or incorporated in the Bailiwick of Guernsey (the Bailiwick) and is not authorised or registered by the Commission.</p>,
    <p class="text-xs">Under the current regime, an entity licensed under the Protection of Investors (Bailiwick of Guernsey) Law, 1987 (a POI licensee) that intends to manage, administer, or provide custody to an NGS is required to give prior written notice to and seek formal approval from the Commission before commencing any of those restricted activities in respect of each NGS (note that a POI licensee may act for an NGS which is authorised in Jersey, Isle of Man, United Kingdom and Ireland without prior approval). Once approved, the POI licensee is subject to the NGS Rules, which are currently only applied in practice to restricted activities carried out in connection with open-ended collective investment schemes.</p>,
    <p class="text-xs">Under the proposals, the requirement for prior notification and approval will be removed and replaced with a requirement that the POI licensee submits additional information in its annual return on the activities it has undertaken in respect of all investment assets serviced in Guernsey. The fees associated with NGS, i.e. notification and annual fees, will naturally fall away.</p>,
    <p class="text-xs">The GFSC must give specific approval to a local licensee before that licensee may commence providing services in relation to a non-Guernsey open-ended scheme. In considering whether or not to approve such a proposal, the GFSC will take into account:</p>,
    <ul class="list-disc ml-4">
      <li class="text-xs">The protection and enhancement of the reputation of the Bailiwick as a financial center;</li>,
      <li class="text-xs">The general nature and specific attributes of the controlled investment business to which the proposal relates; and</li>,
      <li class="text-xs">Any other factors that the GFSC considers appropriate to consider. Normally, approval will only be given if the non-Guernsey open-ended fund would have been likely to obtain authorization under the Protection of Investors (Bailiwick of Guernsey) Law, 1987, as amended.</li>
    </ul>,
