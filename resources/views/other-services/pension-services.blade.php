      The MFSA is responsible for the authorization and subsequent oversight of authorized Service Providers (Retirement Scheme Administrators, Investment Managers, and Custodians), Personal Retirement Schemes, Occupational Retirement Schemes ('Retirement Schemes'), and Retirement Funds in line with the Retirement Pensions Act, subsidiary legislation, and the Pension Rules.
    </p>
    <p class="text-xs">
      Supervision of Service Providers, Retirement Schemes, and Retirement Funds is carried out in a proportionate manner and comprises an appropriate combination of off-site and on-site supervision. In exercising its function and duties under the Retirement Pensions Act, the MFSA ensures that such duties are carried out in a transparent and accountable manner, taking into consideration the protection of members and beneficiaries, the promotion of competition and choice, and the reputation and suitability of the applicant and other connected parties.
    </p>
    <p class="text-xs">
      The current pension scheme in Malta is based on the Social Security Act, Chapter 318 of the Laws of Malta. The Act provides for two basic schemes, the Contributory Scheme, and the Non-Contributory Scheme. In the Contributory Scheme, the basic requirement for entitlement is that specific contribution conditions are satisfied. In the Non-Contributory Scheme, the basic requirement is that the conditions of the means test are satisfied.
    </p>
    <p class="text-xs">
      The Non-Contributory Scheme has made possible the allocation of more than one benefit at the same time, thus providing simultaneous coverage in those cases where more than one contingency is present. Through the process of targeting, this scheme has succeeded in the provision of additional assistance to certain specific categories such as, in the case of persons with a disability, in the case of single parents, as well as in the case of the family as a single unit.
    </p>
    <p class="text-xs">
      The Contributory Scheme is universal since it practically covers all strata of the Maltese society. Within this scheme, employees, self-occupied, and self-employed persons acquire social insurance rights through the payment of a weekly contribution as laid down by the Social Security Act.
